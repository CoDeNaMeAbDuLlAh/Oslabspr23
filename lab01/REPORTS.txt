q5:
This was a quite tricky task , as i had to look into multiple websites to get information.
The first issue was that when I was trying to edit password of user2 while logged into user1 an error message was getting displayed
which stated "user1 is not in sudoers file", so i wrote the following commands to add user1 into sudoers list.
sudo 


sudo adduser newuser
sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser
groups newuser
sudo su - newuser

After these steps I was able to change the password of user2 by logging into user1 .


q6:
I studied about the vim command on www.educba.com.
Firstly,I got to know that vim cam be used to create , edit or manipulate files.
To create a file using vim,  I wrote vim file.txt then i Clicked 'I" to insert information into the file.
Secondly,after entering information into the file i pressed ESC+ :wq to save the file ,and thats all.

vim new_file.txt
Esc + :wq

sort task6.txt > itsort.txt
